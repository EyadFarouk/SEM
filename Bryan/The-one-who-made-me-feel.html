                To the one who made feel<br><br>
                Now you will run and you should fear<br><br>
                A power of the darkness, you have found<br><br>
                Now you will run<br><br>
                And seek for a ground<br><br>
                Half evil and good I contain<br><br>
                And a great revenge I had to chain<br><br>
                Now I know your destination<br><br>
                So tell her that I gave her a salutation<br><br>
                I loved fun and you surly too<br><br>
                But now you will suffer<br><br>
                From pain worse than the flu<br><br>
                I didn't want it to end like that, I lied to myself<br><br>
                As everytime I get a new skull to my shelf<br><br>
                Always loved to stay with you, what a great life<br><br>
                But now it ends<br><br>
                As in ur neck you will see a knife<br><br>
                Great family and friends, why do I become sad<br><br>
                But now it's time for revenge<br><br>
                So don't try to run, because u will hear the clap<br><br>
                And surly you forgot what that was<br><br>
                So get ready to know<br><br>
                When u see my claws<br><br>

                This poem was made by Bryan when he met an amazing friend who made him feel better,
                that friend could understand Bryan, teach him stuff, joke with him alot, dream together
                to help humanity but before meeting that friend, Bryan was going to close his heart as 
                he noticed that being a feeling person was making him feel mentally worse and it really
                did that to him, it even made him think about doing bad stuff like killing, making people
                suffer and to remove his patience.<br>
                So he was going to close his heart but he met that friend and was thinking of
                "Why don't I give that person a chance before closing my heart" and he really did at last,
                so after that person made Bryan open his heart, Bryan got the old feelings of killing people
                and making them suffer that also made Bryan get thoughts about killing that friend
