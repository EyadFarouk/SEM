            <div class="poem Bryan">
                Love is a double edged weopon<br><br>
                As you may waste your life trying to find it<br><br>
                And you may shoot ur heart's arrows and they may never hit<br><br>
                But don't worry mate<br><br>
                As love will find you and it will never be late<br><br>
                And to make sure that you understand love<br><br>
                Love is not about marrying or these 18+ stuff<br><br>
                As love is about caring<br><br>
                Or the feelings that you are sharing<br><br>
                And this is the pure love<br><br>
                That's why love is important<br><br>
                As love is like the gloves<br><br>
                They are needed to warm you in the winter<br><br>
                So do as the love<br><br>
                you need it to warm you when everyone forgot about you later<br><br>

                This poem was made by Bryan when he finally understood what is the real purpose of Love
                and how many people misused love and romance especially that some people even misunderstood love,
                so Bryan made that poem hoping that people remember what is the real meaning love that got buried
                through time as it is never too late to remember and notice the mistake that humans did
