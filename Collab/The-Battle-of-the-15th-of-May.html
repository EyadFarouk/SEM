                How are you bro <br>
                tell me what you have been through <br>
                I'm your friend so don't be scared <br>
                I will be ready to even remove you from the dirt <br>
                An annoying friend, that's what you are <br>
                But sadly we can't see each other because with distance you are far <br>
                How is your brother, he is a great guy <br>
                But sadly when I left him, I forgot to say goodbye <br>

                Shut the fuck up for ever. <br>

                I meant to surprise you with a gift, what did I do wrong Jack <br>
                Or where did I get lost when following the track <br>
                I will never find someone like you, that's a true fact <br>

                Attacking me nude, you shouldn't commit it <br>
                Your busy life lowers your thinking limit <br>
                And I understand, so I will let you permit it <br>
                No matter how annoying you may become <br>

                Significant or not they were, in the end they will remain still as I <br>

                Important or not was myself, in the end I will always <br>

                Giving me hugs and yet I feel nothing <br>
                As if I'm winning in the fight but still not happy in the ring <br>
                I just want happiness, is that a wrong thing to wish? <br>
                But what can I say, life is swimming everywhere like a bluefish <br>
                I want some true feelings, can anyone help me? <br>
                Is feeling happy sth so hard to be? <br>
                Lost my romantic part, it had no use <br>
                It even felt to some people that it's just an abuse <br>

                Romance and friendship, what's the deal? <br>
                Looking forward to a relationship that's not real <br>
                The Media are fake, the dreams are surreal <br>
                But reality is nothing but a sea in it we seal, <br>
                Our hopes. <br>
                The Frost king called out for me earlier than expected <br>
                Had I reached for him late, the punishment would've been neglected <br>
                Yet I was obedient, followed the voice till no more heart reaction was <br>
                immediate. <br>
                A battle of trust and hate, belligerents on both sides weren't late <br>
                Eventually it was nothing but a stalemate. <br>
                Had hopes for a brighter future, had wishes to be among the stars <br>
                Had friends with good texture, had requirements above the needed bars <br>
                Eventually it was nothing but late night soars. <br>
                Reality is often disappointing, they say <br>
                But the truth has it that it's always grey. <br>

                <div class="Bryan">
                Bryan : <br>
                Romance is real, I saw it before <br>
                But it immediately leaved from the shore <br>
                Romance is real, They always tell me <br>
                But just few people who try to never flee <br>
                Romance is real, but who deserves it? <br>
                It's just 1% of the people who with romance they fit <br>
                Friendship might be fake but who cares <br>
                What matters at most is the feeling that he or she shares <br>
                The Media are real, It's just for the person who took it <br>
                But to other people, the photo might be nothing except a piece of shit <br>
                What matters at most are not what they like <br>
                it's just what makes you happy, even if it was the dark of the night <br>
                Hopes for a better future, a curse and a grace <br>
                As it might make you succeed or show giving up in your face <br>
                Just be strong and hold your position they always say <br>
                But if they were me, in this difficulty they can never play <br>
                Reality is so disappointing, noone can deny <br>
                But we must stay in our path until our soul says goodbye <br>
                We can't give up now, we will get stronger in life <br>
                No matter how hard it punches we will continue even if it was five <br>

                Before sunlight came there was darkness <br>
                One that lured every inch of fairness. <br>
                Corruption, poverty, desertification <br>
                Nothing good comes out of this miscommunication <br>
                Yet here comes romance, a little incomprehensible detail <br><br>
